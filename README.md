Fisheries_R_Scripts
===================

The scripts in this repository are a collection of novel R codes that  implements the methodology outlined in my PhD thesis
titled "Growth Estimation in Fisheries". Please feel free to edit and download these files and cite my work if you think it's interesting.

Please don't hesitate to criticise or ask questions.
